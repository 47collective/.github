## About Us
47collective is a collaborative community for builders.

We started this community because many early career builders are having a hard time getting hired by companies. They have expressed their frustration and observation that companies are hiring more experienced engineers.
How does one gain experience if they can't get hired? An unfortuante Catch-22. This community is a mix of early career and later career builders who can help each other. Early career folks need 
the more experienced engineers to think through problems and seek advice. Later career folks need the fresh perspective and energy from the early career people. 
Help each other please!
